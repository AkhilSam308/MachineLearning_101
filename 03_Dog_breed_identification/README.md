# End to End multi-class dog breed identification 

This is a sample project of an end to end multi-class image classifier using Tensor Flow 2.0 & TensorHub for dog breed classification. 

Colab Notebook can be accessed [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yEkXkjhxCxiGoVscXsBft9oyC5fLXsh5?usp=sharing).

## Problem Statement 

To identify the breed of a dog from an image of a dog. (Almost 120 dog breeds)

## Data 

The data is obtained from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition. Can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data
).

## Results 
The following are the results of the model on custom dog images. Some images were downloaded from Google and some were clicked by myself (to have a mix).
