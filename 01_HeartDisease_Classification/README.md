# MachineLearning_Basics

This project is a sample (proof of concept) ML project (done as a part of the course Zero to Mastery ML) for Predicting heart disease using machine learning. 


### Problem
> With clinical data, can we predict whether a patient has a heart diesease or not?

### Data 
Data used in this notebook was obtained from Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data is open source and can be downloaded [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease)

- Logistic Regression 
- KNeighbours Classifier 
- Random Forest Classifier 

Libraries used in this project:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
